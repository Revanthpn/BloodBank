# Blood-Bank Management System - Database based Application
## Introduction
Every year our nation requires about 4 Cr. units of blood, out of which only 5 Lakh units of blood are available. It is not that, people do not want to donate blood. Often they are unaware of the need and also they do not have a proper facility to enquire about it. As a result, needy people end up going through a lot of pain. To solve this problem we choose this problem.

## Problem Statement
The ‘BLOOD BANK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM’ project is to interconnect all the blood banks, hospitals, donors into a single network, validation, store various data and information of blood of each individual. This system is used to store data over a centralized server which consists of database where the individual’s information cannot be accessed by a third party.
